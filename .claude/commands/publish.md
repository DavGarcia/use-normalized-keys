# Publishing New Version

Follow the exact publishing workflow documented in README.md:

## Step 1: Pre-flight Checks
1. Read README.md to confirm current publishing guidelines
2. Verify we're in the correct project directory
3. Check git status to ensure clean working directory
4. Confirm we're on the main branch

## Step 2: Update All Package Versions
1. Move to `packages/use-normalized-keys/` directory
2. Check current version in package.json
3. Ask user what type of version bump: patch/minor/major
4. Run `npm version [type]` to bump main package version
5. **CRITICAL:** Update root `package.json` version to match
6. **CRITICAL:** Update `docs/package.json` version to match
7. Return to root directory and run `npm install` to update lockfile

## Step 3: Quality Assurance  
1. Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
2. Verify TypeScript compilation with `npx tsc --noEmit`
3. Only proceed if all checks pass

## Step 4: Git Operations
1. Ask user for descriptive commit message (or create one)
2. Stage all changes with `git add .` (includes all package.json files + lockfile)
3. Commit with descriptive message including version bump
4. Create git tag for the new version
5. **DO NOT PUSH** - user will push via GitHub Desktop

## Step 5: Instructions for User
Provide clear instructions for:
- How to push commits via GitHub Desktop to origin/main
- How to push tags using **Repository â†’ Push Tags** (Ctrl+Shift+T)
- **Emphasize:** Both commits AND tags must be pushed to trigger release
- Links to monitor GitHub Actions workflow
- Links to verify npm publication
- Links to check GitHub releases

## Important Notes
- Never run `npm publish` manually
- All package.json files must have matching versions (root, docs, main package)
- GitHub Actions uses npm Trusted Publishing (no token needed)
- The automated workflow ensures consistent production builds
- User must push both commits and tags to trigger release

Follow this workflow exactly as documented in the README.md publishing guidelines.
