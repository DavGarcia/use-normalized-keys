# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Package Metadata & Legal (Foundation)
> Created: 2025-08-04
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Establish proper package identity and legal framework for the use-normalized-keys React hook library to prepare it for open source distribution. This foundational phase will provide complete package metadata, comprehensive documentation, proper licensing, and npm package configuration.

## User Stories

### Open Source Maintainer Story

As an open source maintainer, I want to prepare the use-normalized-keys package with complete metadata and legal framework, so that developers can discover, install, and contribute to the library with confidence.

The maintainer needs proper package.json metadata (description, keywords, repository), comprehensive README documentation with usage examples and API reference, MIT license for broad compatibility, and .npmignore configuration to ensure clean package distribution.

### Developer Discovery Story

As a developer building interactive web applications, I want to easily discover and understand the use-normalized-keys library through npm search and the package page, so that I can quickly evaluate if it meets my keyboard input handling needs.

The developer expects clear package description, relevant keywords for discoverability, comprehensive README with installation instructions and code examples, and proper version strategy that indicates library maturity.

### Legal Compliance Story

As a developer or organization, I want to use the use-normalized-keys library in my projects with clear legal understanding, so that I can comply with licensing requirements and avoid legal complications.

The legal user needs an explicit MIT license file, clear author attribution in package.json, and proper repository URL for license verification and contribution guidelines.

## Spec Scope

1. **Package.json Metadata Update** - Complete package.json with description, author, keywords, repository URL, and proper version strategy
2. **Comprehensive README.md** - Installation guide, usage examples, API documentation, and library overview for npm package page
3. **MIT License File** - Standard MIT license text with proper copyright attribution for open source compatibility
4. **NPM Package Configuration** - .npmignore file to exclude development files and ensure clean package distribution
5. **Version Strategy Implementation** - Decide on initial version (0.1.0 vs 1.0.0) based on library maturity and API stability

## Out of Scope

- Monorepo workspace configuration (Phase 2)
- Documentation site creation (Phase 3)
- CI/CD pipeline setup (Phase 4)
- Performance optimization or API changes
- Additional testing or demo enhancements

## Expected Deliverable

1. Package discoverable on npm with complete metadata and proper search keywords
2. Comprehensive README.md visible on npm package page with clear installation and usage instructions
3. MIT license file present in package root for legal compliance verification
