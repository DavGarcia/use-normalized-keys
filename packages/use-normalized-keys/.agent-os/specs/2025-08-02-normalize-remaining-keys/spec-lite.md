# Spec Summary (Lite)

Extend the existing key normalization functionality to handle additional shifted punctuation keys beyond just numbers, providing consistent key values when Shift is held down. This completes the normalization coverage by handling keys like -=[]\;' and other punctuation that currently report their shifted values instead of their base characters.
