# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Normalize Remaining Keyboard Keys
> Created: 2025-08-02
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Extend the existing key normalization functionality to handle additional shifted punctuation keys beyond just numbers, providing consistent key values when Shift is held down. This feature will complete the normalization coverage by handling keys like -=[]\;' and other punctuation that currently report their shifted values instead of their base characters.

## User Stories

### Developer Using Keyboard Shortcuts

As a developer building a keyboard-driven application, I want all punctuation keys to be normalized consistently when Shift is held, so that I can create predictable keyboard shortcuts without worrying about shifted symbol variations.

When a user presses Shift+- (which produces _), the normalized key should be - for consistent hotkey detection. Similarly, Shift+= should normalize to =, Shift+[ should normalize to [, etc. This allows developers to bind actions to the base keys without handling both shifted and unshifted variants.

### End User with Consistent Key Behavior

As an end user of applications using normalized keys, I want keyboard shortcuts to work consistently regardless of whether I accidentally press Shift, so that my muscle memory and workflow remain uninterrupted.

For example, if an application uses = for zoom-in functionality, pressing Shift+= (which produces +) should still trigger the same action, providing a more forgiving and intuitive user experience.

## Spec Scope

1. **Punctuation Key Normalization** - Normalize shifted punctuation keys (-, =, [, ], \, ;, ') to their base characters
2. **Mapping Table Extension** - Add comprehensive symbol-to-base-character mappings for US QWERTY layout
3. **Test Coverage** - Ensure all new normalizations are thoroughly tested with edge cases
4. **Documentation Updates** - Update code comments and examples to reflect expanded normalization coverage
5. **Backward Compatibility** - Maintain existing number key normalization behavior without changes

## Out of Scope

- Non-US keyboard layouts (future enhancement)
- Function key normalization (F1, F2, etc.)
- Dead key handling for international characters
- Context-sensitive normalization based on application state

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can rely on consistent key values for all common punctuation keys when building keyboard shortcuts
2. All shifted punctuation symbols are normalized to their base characters (e.g., _ → -, + → =, { → [, } → ], | → \, : → ;, " → ')
3. Comprehensive test suite validates all new normalization mappings work correctly across different scenarios
